BigSoundDj - A port of [LittleSoundDj](https://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/index.php) for platforms that aren't the Gameboy and Gameboy Color.

I do apologize for bad code structuring and such. This is my first Rust project so I'm definitely learning along the way.
Assistance with features, refactoring, or how some of the sound features work would be appreciated.

Future features I would love to add include a font and palette editor, saving to an imported ROM file, saving songs locally, and exporting songs, however this project is far off from all of those yet.
